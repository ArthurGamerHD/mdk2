# MDKÂ²-SE
_(Malware's Development Kit for SE)_

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/malware-dev/mdk2/actions/workflows/buildwithartefacts.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/malware-dev/mdk2/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

A toolkit to help with developing both **programmable block scripts** and **mods** for Keen Software Houseâ€™s space sandbox *Space Engineers*. It sets up a ready-to-code Visual Studio project, checks for disallowed code, and includes a script minifier for programmable blocks.

### General features
* Supports both programmable block scripts and mods
* Creates a fully connected project in Visual Studio with all references set up
* Includes an analyzer that warns when you're using code that isnâ€™t allowed in *Space Engineers*
* Supports Visual Studio Shared Projects for reusable code across scripts and mods

## For programmable block scripts
* Deploys your script into a single file and places it in your local Workshop folder â€” no copy/paste needed
* Optional code minifier to help stay within the programmable block's size and instruction limits

### Remarks:
* Requires that you have the game installed, but does _not_ require you to have it running

## Important Note
This is a project I pretty much made for _myself_. I'm publishing it in case someone else might have a use for it. Fair warning: Make requests, by all means, but if your request is not something I myself have any use for, someone else is gonna have to do the work. I'm fully employed, and this is a spare-time project. I'll be working on it on and off.

## Contribution
Sure thing! I'd be happy to accept contributions to the project. I'm especially grateful for help with features that I might not personally need. Since my time is limited, I mostly focus on features I plan to use. So, extra features, like mod support, depend on community contributions. However, I won't merge contributions blindly. They need to meet a certain standard, and I reserve the right to reject features I don't like. Just a heads-up! ðŸ˜„

## Getting Started
