v.2.0.0-alpha54
 - Fixed an issue where the mdk2 .ini file ignores were made with ; as a separator rather than ,.

v.2.0.0-alpha52
 - Added a warning if the final composed script exceeds the maximum allowed character count of the programmable block.

v.2.0.0-alpha51
 - Final structure (I think) for MDK2 command line.
 - Now notifying when new nuget packages are available (currently just Mal.MDK2.PbPackager).
 - Changed to an .ini based configuration rather than an msbuild based one.
 - Added an auto-migrator to add MDK2 support to MDK1 projects.

v.2.0.0-alpha1
 - Emergency publish of a very early build due to the problems with MDK1 and the new version of Visual Studio 2022.
 - This version is highly untested, and is missing the minifier.
