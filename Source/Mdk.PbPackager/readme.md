# MDK Analyzers

---

The game [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
(by [Keen Software House](https://www.keenswh.com/), no affiliation) supports
scripting and modding using the C# language. This project allows scripters to use full projects
for their scripts, with separate code files and mixin (shared project) libraries, by reading
the projects and compiling them into a single script file the game can use.

_This package is part of the MDK2 project._

### Usage:

Usage description pending: This is an emergency release due to the problems with MDK1 and the latest Visual Studio 2022
version. A more detailed description will be added later.
